        <h2>How to Grill Salmon</h2>
        <p>Grilling the perfect salmon is probably easier than you think. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Season and marinate the salmon for at least two hours in the refrigerator. Preheat a grill and lightly oil the grate. Place the salmon on the grill and discard the marinade. Cook on each side until the fish flakes easily with a fork.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds salmon fillets</li>
            <li>lemon pepper to taste</li>
            <li>garlic powder to taste</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season salmon fillets with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>Stir soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil together in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Place fish in a large resealable plastic bag; add soy sauce mixture, seal, and turn to coat. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Place salmon on the preheated grill, and discard marinade. Cook salmon until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 6 to 8 minutes per side.</li>
