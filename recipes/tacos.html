            <li>crushed red pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 lime</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can tomatillos</li>
            <li>2 fresh jalpeño peppers, seeded</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
            <li>12 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1/2 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>1 avocado = peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place sliced meat into a shallow bowl, and season with salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. Squeeze the lime juice over the meat, and turn until evenly coated. Cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a blender or food processor, combine tomatillo and jalapeno. Puree for 15 to 20 seconds, or until thick. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Carefully pour in tomatillo mixture. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Stir in beef broth. Reduce heat, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until mixture coats a spoon. Transfer mixture to a serving dish.</li>
            <li>Heat tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Stir in 1/3 of the beef, and saute for 1 minute. Transfer to serving dish. Repeat with remaining beef. Meanwhile, heat tortillas in the oven or microwave, according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>To serve, place two tortillas on top of each other. Add desired amount of meat, spoon over some tomatillo mixture. Top with onions, tomatoes, avocado and cilantro. Garnish with a wedge of lemon, to be squeezed over taco before eating.</li>
